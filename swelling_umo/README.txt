Preliminary UMo fuel swelling and fuel gas bubble swelling datasets calculated by Zhi-Gang Mei on 12/16/2021 using DART code.

********************************************
Grain_size (12 grain sizes), operation_days, heat_flux (9 heat fluxes, which determine fission rate) are inputs for DART calculations. Fuel temperature, fission rate, fission density, fuel swelling and fuel gas swelling are outputs.

The difference between fuel swellings and fuel gas swelling is that the former including solid fission product while the latter doesn't.

**** Units for each column in the table ****

fission rate: 10^14 fission/cm^3/second
fuel_temp: degree Celcius
fission density: 10^21 fission/cm^3
fuel_swelling: %
